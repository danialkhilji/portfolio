                <li>Designed and continuously improved the taxonomy mapping process for the Audience Translator project, enabling >1K users in just Q1 to map source taxonomies (mainly Audience Origin) to ad-tech platforms like Meta and Google, plus handling bespoke mappings on request.</li>
                <li>Partnered with engineers to automate mappings with Airflow, reducing turnaround time from weeks to under one week by running taxonomy similarity, calculating KPIs, storing results, and notifying users.</li>
                <li>Built and maintain a Python package for taxonomy similarity, now adopted across multiple teams. Enhanced it with taxonomy cleaning, automated KPI calculation, model evaluation, and user flexibility to adjust models and weights.</li>
                <li>Integrated pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT models, developed a weighted similarity algorithm, and continue to research optimization for mapping quality.</li>
                <li>Developed an evaluation module with text corruption strategies, ground-truth validation, and confusion matrices to test algorithmic performance.</li>
                <li>Implemented LLM-based features (GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro) including taxonomy enrichment with descriptions and lightweight RAG functionality using Python dictionaries for efficient vector storage, improving semantic accuracy without relying on external databases.</li>
                <li>Developed an automated LLM supervision layer, using GPT-4 and GPT-4o, to pre-review mapped taxonomies before human validation, significantly reducing manual review time and streamlining the overall mapping workflow.</li>
                <li>Investigated geo-targeted advertising inaccuracies with Snowflake queries, analyzing device ID matching across partners and identifying data noise. Consulted on email matching optimization for campaigns using probabilistic matching algorithms and normalization techniques. Created a comprehensive QA framework with automated validation checks and data profiling metrics to evaluate new partner data onboarding, ensuring campaign targeting accuracy and maintaining data quality standards.</li>
                <li>Investigated Habu clean rooms to enable secure and collaborative data sharing with clients from a data science perspective.</li>
                <li>Developed a multi-agent system using LangGraph and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for modular tool integration, implementing async/sync bridging to connect protocol servers with LangChain workflows. Built multi-provider LLM orchestration (Azure OpenAI for GPTs, Vertex AI for Claude models) with self-reflection loops, semantic duplicate detection for Jira automation, and comprehensive logging infrastructure for automated API research and code generation.</li>

                <li>Contributed to the Audience Knowledge Graph (AKG) project, developing taxonomy mapping module, data cleaning steps for data clean rooms, and Looker Studio dashboard for monitoring each module progress among other tasks.</li>
                <li>Created Python package to expose taxonomy mapping project to different teams within company. Package uses pre-trained BERT language models from Hugging Face library to generate vector embeddings which are used to calculate cosine similarity.</li>
                <li>Focus on taxonomy mapping work also known as Named Entity Resolution (NER). Improved the previously developed algorithm by removing loops and reducing time complexity from O(n) to O(1).</li>
